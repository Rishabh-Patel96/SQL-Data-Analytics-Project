# Data Analytics Project #
A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

## 🌟 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Rishabh Patel.


I work at the intersection of operations and data, with a strong focus on using analytics to improve supply chain, inventory, and fulfillment performance. My path into data analytics was not title-driven—it was built hands-on, by working directly with operational data and using it to solve real business problems.

I hold a B.Tech in Civil Engineering, where I developed a structured, analytical way of thinking, and later completed a Post-Baccalaureate in Supply Chain Management from Thompson Rivers University. That combination—engineering discipline plus frontline supply chain exposure—shaped how I approach data: logically, systematically, and with real operational context.

Across roles in shipping coordination, inventory control, and client services, I found myself consistently working with data—tracking orders and inventory, validating records, analyzing discrepancies, monitoring SLAs, and building reports to explain what was happening and why. Over time, this evolved from Excel-based analysis into SQL-driven querying and structured reporting, particularly using Microsoft SQL Server to investigate trends, reconcile variances, and support performance monitoring.

Rather than waiting for a formal analytics title, I leaned into the work itself:
writing SQL queries to extract operational data, building repeatable reports, defining KPIs, and translating warehouse and fulfillment activity into insights that teams could act on. This is what ultimately solidified my transition into data analytics.

Today, my focus is on turning raw operational data into clean, reliable insights—whether that means analyzing logistics performance, improving reporting accuracy, or helping teams understand where processes break down and how data can fix them.

Technical Skills
• SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
• Excel (data analysis, reporting, validation)
• Power BI Desktop & Service 
• Python

Core Strengths • Supply chain, inventory, and fulfillment analytics:

• KPI definition, tracking, and performance monitoring
• SQL-based data analysis and reporting
• Root cause analysis of operational issues
• Translating complex operational data into clear insights.

I enjoy working with teams that value data-backed decisions, especially in logistics, supply chain, and operations-heavy environments. If you’re building, analyzing, or improving systems where data meets real-world execution, I’m always open to connecting.
